<h1>Notes on SimpleTAL</h1>
  <p id="subject">Notes, known limitations, and differences between SimpleTAL and Zope's ZPT.</p>
  <div><h2>Upgrading from SimpleTAL 4.x to 5.x</h2>
<p>Porting SimpleTAL to Python 3 has introduced a number of small changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>simpleTALUtils.HTMLStructureCleaner is not available from SimpleTAL 5 onwards.&nbsp; The sgmlib library that it utilised was removed in Python 3.</li>
<li>simpleTAL.compileHTMLTemplate no longer accepts the inputEncoding argument.&nbsp; All HTML templates must be either Strings or file objects that produce Strings.</li>
<li>compileDOMTemplate is not available from SimpleTAL 5 onwards.&nbsp; The pyxml library that provides the Dom2SaxParser implementation is not yet available in Python 3.</li>
<li>simpleTALUtils.ExpandMacros defaults to utf-8 for outputEncoding rather than iso-8859-1.</li>
<li>simpleTALUtils.FastStringOutput has been removed in favour of the new io.StringIO which is faster.</li>
<li>simpleTALUtils.TemplateCache.getTemplate now defaults to utf-8 rather than iso-8859-1 for HTML templates.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Some notes on aspects of SimpleTAL that might require a little explanation.&nbsp; If there is something you feel should be included in here, please let me know.</p>
<h3><a name="htmlTemplates">HTML and XHTML Templates</a></h3>
<p>SimpleTAL processes HTML templates slightly differently to XML templates.&nbsp; In the HTML 4.01 specification there are several elements (e.g. &lt;img&gt;) for which end tags are forbidden.&nbsp; This would normally cause a problem with TAL, because all tags that have TAL attributes on them must be closed.&nbsp; To solve this problem SimpleTAL will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow TAL attributes on all HTML elements that forbid close tags, and process them despite the lack of close tag</li>
<li>When compiling a HTML template issue a warning if a close tag is present for elements that are forbidden to have close tags.</li>
<li>Suppress the output of close tags for elements that are forbidden to have close tags.</li>
</ul>
<p>These changes ensure that a HTML template can still be a valid HTML document, even if TAL needs to be used on elements that forbid end tags.&nbsp; Additionally the output from the expanded template will also be valid HTML, in that the end tags will be suppressed even if present in the template.</p>
<p>As a consequence of this it is important that any XHTML templates are handled as XML rather than HTML, i.e. by calling compileXMLTemplate to compile the template.</p>
<h3>Character set encoding</h3>
<p>HTML templates can be provided as a string or a file like object that generates strings.&nbsp; If loading from a file use open (filename, 'rt', encoding = "character-set") to load the template encoded in a particular character set.</p>
<p>XML templates specify within the document what encoding they use and so can be passed as a string, bytes, or a file like object.&nbsp; When using strings the XML must have been originally in UTF-8.&nbsp; To load from a file use open (filename, 'rb').</p>
<p>When expanding a template SimpleTAL will determine whether to write out strings if the output file is a sub-class of io.TextIOBase or codecs.StreamWriter.&nbsp; Otherwise the file like object will be assumed to require bytes, and the output will be encoded first using 'outputEncoding', which defaults to utf-8.</p>
<h3>Structured Content</h3>
<p>When content is included into a template using 'tal:content' or 'tal:replace' the content is by default treated as text.&nbsp; This means that the '&lt;', '&gt;' and '&amp;' characters will be automatically escaped so that they appear in the rendered template correctly.</p>
<p>When using the 'structure' keyword, however, SimpleTAL will pass the content straight through into the template with no escaping.&nbsp; As such it's important to realise that the content placed into a template in such a way can affect the validity of the output.&nbsp; For example if you take user input that contains HTML markup it's important to ensure that the markup is valid HTML, otherwise the resulting template output will not be valid.</p>
<h3>Object Attributes versus Key Values</h3>
<p>When adding a mapping object (e.g. a Dictionary) to the Context, care should be taken on the naming conventions used within the mapping.&nbsp; When SimpleTAL resolves a path, it will first look for attributes on the object with that name, before trying to treat the object as a mapping object.&nbsp; What this means in practice is that paths which match object attributes (e.g. methods) will never select the values given in the mapping.&nbsp; As an example of this consider the following:</p>
<pre>
<code>
Template:&nbsp; &lt;p tal:repeat="item dict/items"&gt;&lt;b tal:replace="item"&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Context:&nbsp; 
myDict = {'items': [1,2,3]}
Context.addGlobal ("dict", myDict)

</code>
</pre>
<p>You would expect the output from this to be:</p>
<pre>
<code>&lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;</code>
</pre>
<p>However the variable "item" will be set to the output of "myDict.items()" - i.e. it will call the Python dictionary method 'items()'.</p>
<h3>Using &lt; and &gt; in TAL Paths</h3>
<p>When using the 'python:' path type, care must be taken with the use of the less than (&lt;) and greater than (&gt;) signs.&nbsp; These must be escaped in the same way as all other HTML markup.&nbsp; For example:</p>
<p>use: <code>&lt;div tal:condition="python: a &amp;lt; b"&gt;Conditional Text&lt;/div&gt;</code><br>
instead of: <code>&lt;div tal:condition="python: a &lt; b"&gt;Conditional Text&lt;/div&gt;</code></p>
<h2>Known limitations</h2>
<ol>
<li>Repeat Variables do not support 'first' and 'last'.</li>
<li>When using 'not:' on an empty expression the result will be true rather than an error.</li>
<li>Path type 'python:' is not supported by default.&nbsp; You can enable this by passing allowPythonPath=1 to the Context constructor.&nbsp; Note that this should only be used when the authors of the templates are completely trusted, the code included in the 'python:' path can do anything.</li>
<li>TAL markup "on-error" is not yet supported.</li>
<li>HTML Templates will have duplicate attributes if an attribute is added using "tal:attributes" and the name is in upper case.&nbsp; The cause of this is the HTMLParser implementation, which always converts attributes to lower case.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Known differences</h2>
<p>Non-existent path types, e.g. '&lt;b tal:content="total: $totalAmount"&gt;&lt;/b&gt;' are not supported.&nbsp; In Zope, this results in the path being interpreted as a string - in simpleTAL/ES the result will be an error.</p>
