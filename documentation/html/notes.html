<h1>Notes on SimpleTAL</h1>
  <p id="subject">Notes, known limitations, and differences between SimpleTAL and Zope's ZPT.</p>
  <div><h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Some notes on aspects of SimpleTAL that might require a little explanation.&nbsp; If there is something you feel should be included in here, please let me know.</p>
<h3><a name="htmlTemplates">HTML and XHTML Templates</a></h3>
<p>As a bug fix version 2.1 of SimpleTAL now processes HTML templates slightly differently to XML templates.&nbsp; In the HTML 4.01 specification there are several elements (e.g. &lt;img&gt;) for which end tags are forbidden.&nbsp; This would normally cause a problem with TAL, because all tags that have TAL attributes on them must be closed.&nbsp; To solve this problem SimpleTAL has been modified to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow TAL attributes on all HTML elements that forbid close tags, and process them despite the lack of close tag</li>
<li>When compiling a HTML template issue a warning if a close tag is present for elements that are forbidden to have close tags.&nbsp; (Only supported if logging is installed)</li>
<li>To suppress the output of close tags for elements that are forbidden to have close tags.</li>
</ul>
<p>These changes ensure that a HTML template can still be a valid HTML document, even if TAL needs to be used on elements that forbid end tags.&nbsp; Additionally the output from the expanded template will also be valid HTML, in that the end tags will be suppressed even if present in the template.</p>
<p>As a consequence of this change it is important that any XHTML templates are handled as XML rather than HTML, i.e. by calling compileXMLTemplate to compile the template.</p>
<h3>Character set encoding</h3>
<p>SimpleTAL fully supports international character sets, providing all of the encoding options that Python supports.&nbsp; To painlessly support the correct conversion between character sets, just follow these simple rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>When calling compileHTMLTemplate pass in the character set encoding the template was written in.</li>
<li>A template passed to compileXMLTemplate must be a well formed XML document.&nbsp; If it's not in UTF-8 then ensure the prolog of the document specifies what format it is in.</li>
<li>Convert to unicode all strings passed into SimpleTALES.Context</li>
<li>When calling template.expand, pass in the encoding you would like the template output to be in.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Structured Content</h3>
<p>When content is included into a template using 'tal:content' or 'tal:replace' the content is by default treated as text.&nbsp; This means that the '&lt;', '&gt;' and '&amp;' characters will be automatically escaped so that they appear in the rendered template correctly.</p>
<p>When using the 'structure' keyword, however, SimpleTAL will pass the content straight through into the template with no escaping.&nbsp; As such it's important to realise that the content placed into a template in such a way can affect the validity of the output.&nbsp; For example if you take user input that contains HTML markup it's important to ensure that the markup is valid HTML, otherwise the resulting template output will not be valid.&nbsp; In order to assist in doing this I've put together a class (HTMLStructureCleaner) in <a href="api-simpletalutils.html">simpleTALUtils</a> that will escape any stray&nbsp; '&lt;', '&gt;' or '&amp;' characters present while leaving all elements and attributes intact.</p>
<p>The restriction in SimpleTAL 1.x when including structured content into an XML template is now removed - the structure is not re-parsed, and so does not have to be valid XML.</p>
<h3>Object Attributes versus Key Values</h3>
<p>When adding a mapping object (e.g. a Dictionary) to the Context, care should be taken on the naming conventions used within the mapping.&nbsp; When SimpleTAL/ES resolves a path, it will first look for attributes on the object with that name, before trying to treat the object as a mapping object.&nbsp; What this means in practice is that paths which match object attributes (e.g. methods) will never select the values given in the mapping.&nbsp; As an example of this consider the following:</p>
<pre>
<code>
Template:&nbsp; &lt;p tal:repeat="item dict/items"&gt;&lt;b tal:replace="item"&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Context:&nbsp; 
myDict = {'items': [1,2,3]}
Context.addGlobal ("dict", myDict)

</code>
</pre>
<p>You would expect the output from this to be:</p>
<pre>
<code>&lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;</code>
</pre>
<p>However this is not what happens.&nbsp; Instead the variable "item" will be set to the output of "myDict.items()" - i.e. it will call the Python dictionary method 'items()'.</p>
<p>I have considered changing this so that mapping checks are made first in path resolution rather than attribute lookups.&nbsp; When I checked the Zope 2.5 behaviour however, I found that it works the same way as SimpleTAL, so for now I've left it to be consistent with Zope.</p>
<h3>Using &lt; and &gt; in TAL Paths</h3>
<p>When using the 'python:' path type, care must be taken with the use of the less than (&lt;) and greater than (&gt;) signs.&nbsp; These must be escaped in the same way as all other HTML markup.&nbsp; For example:</p>
<p>use: <code>&lt;div tal:condition="python: a &amp;lt; b"&gt;Conditional Text&lt;/div&gt;</code><br>
instead of: <code>&lt;div tal:condition="python: a &lt; b"&gt;Conditional Text&lt;/div&gt;</code></p>
<h2>Known limitations</h2>
<ol>
<li>In the Zope implementation of TAL any elements in the TAL or METAL namespace have no start or end tags written out.&nbsp; This is supported in SimpleTAL version 3.0 onwards, but only for XML templates.&nbsp; HTML templates can not have elements in anything other than the default namespace.&nbsp; This is a limitation of the Python sgmllib implementation.</li>
<li>Repeat Variables do not support 'first' and 'last'.</li>
<li>When using 'not:' on an empty expression the result will be true rather than an error.</li>
<li>Path type 'python:' is not supported by default.&nbsp; You can enable this by passing allowPythonPath=1 to the Context constructor.&nbsp; Note that this should only be used when the authors of the templates are completely trusted, the code included in the 'python:' path can do anything.</li>
<li>TAL markup "on-error" is not yet supported.</li>
<li>HTML Templates will have duplicate attributes if an attribute is added using "tal:attributes" and the name is in upper case.&nbsp; The cause of this is the sgmllib implementation which always converts attributes to lower case.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Known differences</h2>
<p>Non-existent path types, e.g. '&lt;b tal:content="total: $totalAmount"&gt;&lt;/b&gt;' are not supported.&nbsp; In Zope, this results in the path being interpreted as a string - in simpleTAL/ES the result will be an error.</p>
