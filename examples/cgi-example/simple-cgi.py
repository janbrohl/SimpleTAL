		A demonstration of how TAL/TALES can be used from a cgi program.  Quick instructions:
			1 - Copy this file and the two templates ("fields.html" and "results.html") to 
			    the cgi-bin directory on your webserver
			2 - Ensure that simpleTAL, simpleTALES and DummyLogger are installed in your site-packages
			    directory
			3 - Go to http://servername/cgi-bin/simple-cgi.py
		
		Module Dependencies: simpleTAL, simpleTALES
