simpleTAL / simpleTALES (Version 3.13)
-------------------------------------
Version 3.13
------------
New features:
 - Added support for compiling a template from a DOM tree (thanks to Benjamin Niemann for the 
   patch).
 - Added support for iterators in the Context (thanks to Kevin Smith for the ideas).

Bug fixes:
 - ElementTree paths can now be used from 'python: path ()' expressions (thanks to Jochen   
   Kupperschmidt for the fix).

Version 3.12
------------
New features:
 - Integration with ElementTree.
 - Use Python 2.2's unicode function if available (honours the __unicode__ method) when 
   converting non-unicode variables in the Context.
 
Bug fixes:
 - Allow sub-classes of string and Unicode strings to be placed in the Context.
 
Version 3.11
------------
This release changes how HTML templates containing entity references and character references are 
handled.  In previous releases any references contained in the HTML would be passed through to 
the output intact.  In order to solve the double escaping bug described below all character references
are now expanded in the output with the exception of &lt;, &gt; and &amp;

Bug fixes:
 - If multiple variable substitutions are used in a single 'string:' path and one failed
   the whole path would evaluate to an empty string.
 - When <input name="name"> was used <input name=""> was output.
 - The global variable 'attrs' should be a dictionary, not a list
   (Thanks to Christoph Zwerschke for the bug report).
 - Content accessed through attrs would be double escaped.

Version 3.10
------------
New features:
 - Included API documentation and TAL reference guide with archive.
 
Bug fixes:
 - Attributes on repeat tags were not correctly kept for nested repeats.
   (Thanks to Aadish Shrestha for the bug report)

Version 3.9
-----------
This is release is focused on improving performance.  Compared to version 3.8
the performance of expanding templates is ~45-70% faster.  The performance of parsing
templates is unchanged.

WARNING: IF you rely on the internal workings of SimpleTALES in your application then
there will be changes that are required to make use of this version of SimpleTAL.  The API
for SimpleTAL is however unchanged.

New features:
  - Introduced simpleTALUtils.FastStringOutput which can be used to capture the 
    output of SimpleTAL in a faster manner than StringIO.
  - Introduced simpleTALES.CachedFuncResult which can be used to wrap functions in
    the Context, and which cache's the result of the function call to ensure that
	the function is only called once during template expansion.
  - TALES no longer wraps all results in ContextVariable instances when returning
    values to TAL.
  - Changed copy.copy to {}.copy for performance improvement.
  - Removed logging.debug() calls from performance critical paths.
  - Replaced DefaultVariable class with simpleTALES.DEFAULTVALUE
  - Replaced NothingVariable class with None
  - Removed NoCallVariable
  - Removed isDefault, isNothing, isSequence, isCallable, and isTrue from ContextVariable.
  

Version 3.8
-----------
New features:
  - Added new method getXMLTemplate to simpleTALUtils.TemplateCache
  - Comments in XML templates are now included in the output if pyxml is
    installed.
  - Lists can now be indexed into.
	
Bug fixes:
  - TAL commands on METAL namespaced elements and vice-versa now work correctly
    (thanks to Kevin Smith for the bug report).
  
Version 3.7
-----------
New features:
  - When non-ascii, non-Unicode strings are present in the Context a Unicode
    error is thrown.  Now an ERROR log message indicates that this is the most
    likely cause of the problem.
    
Bug fixes:
  - Correction to cgi-example (thanks to Frank Wierzbicki for the patch).
  - Local defines that reference earlier local defines on one tag now work.
  - Using default values in a repeat list now work as expected.
  - Errors during codec conversions will now use 'replace' rather than 'strict'
  

Version 3.6
-----------

New features:
  - The XML Declaration can now be suppressed by passing 
	suppressXMLDeclaration=1 to the template "expand" method.
Bug fixes:
  - Removed stray 'info' logging call.
  
Version 3.5
-----------
New features:
  - The 'test' function is now available to code used in 'python:' paths.
    Usage is the same as zope: test (test1,val1[,test2,val2][,default]).
	(Thanks to Mark McEahern for the feature request)
  - Uses PyXML (http://pyxml.sourceforge.net/) to determine the DOCTYPE of
    XML templates (if installed).  (Thanks to Myers Carpenter for the 
    implementation)
Bug fixes:
  - CGI Example fixes.
  - XML Templates containing attributes with character entities are now
    output correctly.
  - HTML Templates with special characters as part of TAL or METAL commands
    are now handled correctly.
  - Default encoding is now iso-8859-1 rather than iso8859-1


Version 3.4
-----------
New features:
  - TemplateCache now uses MTIME rather than CTIME to spot
    changes to templates.
  - SimpleTAL is now compatible with PyXML 0.8.2 (Thanks to 
    Myers Carpenter for the testing).
  - Added support for passing in an XML Doctype when calling 
	template.expand
  - Added support to maintain XML singleton tags, including use of 
    METAL and TAL on singleton tags.
  - Added support for using variables in paths (e.g. If colour='blue' then
	the path 'colourMap/?colour' is equivalent to 'colourMap/blue').  This 
    is not part of the TALES specification, but is supported by Zope.
	(Thanks to Bastian Kleineidam for the initial implementation).
	
Bug fixes:
  - If the logging module was not installed exceptions would be thrown
    when SimpleTAL attempted to log errors - fixed.

Version 3.3
-----------
New features:
  - TemplateCache now supports inputEncoding, allowing HTML templates using 
    character sets other than ISO8859-1 to be used.
  - Functions path, string, exists, and nocall are available to python: paths.
  - Functions can now receive parameters via paths by wrapping them in 
    simpleTALES.PathFunctionVariable before placing them into the Context.
    
Bug fixes:
  - In tal:attributes and tal:define double escaped semi-colons are now handled.
  - Space after a semi-colon in tal:attributes and tal:define is now handled
    (thanks to Sean Reifschneider)
  - Handling of stray quotes at the start and end of attributes shouldn't interfere
    with python: paths anymore.

Version 3.2
-----------
This release incorporates patches from Wichert Akkerman implementing the Python TAL path
and moving to string methods instead of using the string module.

New features:
  - The 'python:' path can now be used, pass the parameter 'allowPythonPath=1' to the
	constructor of SimpleTALES.Context to enable this to be used.
  - simpleTALUtils now contains a template caching class (TemplateCache) that
    can be used to cache compiled templates, automatically invalidating the cache if
	the template file has changed.
  - The string module is no longer used, replaced by string methods
  
Bug fixes:
  - Nested repeat variables with the same name are now scoped correctly.
  - If logging is available all error messages are now suppressed during testing.

Version 3.1
-----------
With this release import statements need to be changed.  Please now use:
from simpletal import simpleTAL, simpleTALES.  The API has not changed.

New features:
  - SimpleTAL can now be installed using distutils, thanks to Michael Twomey.
    
Bug fixes:
  - If tal:repeat and tal:content were used on the same element, the last piece of
    content would be present twice - fixed.
  - If a path element inside a string: path evaluated to something other than a string or
    unicode string, it would not be evaluated.  Now an attempt to coerce the value to a 
    string is done using the str function.

Version 3.0
-----------
New features:
  - METAL Support added
  - The TAL and METAL name-spaces can now be bound to any prefix
  - When using XML Templates any elements in the TAL or METAL name-space
    have their start and end tags suppressed.

Version 2.3
-----------
Bug fixes:
  - Using tal:repeat on empty lists would cause an exception to be thrown.
    Now the repeating elements are removed from the output.

Version 2.2
-----------
Bug fixes:
  - HTML Document type declarations were not being passed through from the template
  - HTML Comments are now passed through to the output
  - End tags with no start tag now raise an error rather than failing silently
  - The first text element in a template is now combined with other text elements
  - XML Processing Instructions are now passed through the template correctly.

Version 2.1
-----------
Bug fixes:
  - HTML Templates will now suppress the output of close tags for elements
    that are forbidden to have them in HTML 4.01.  Additionally tags that 
    can have no close tag in HTML can still have TAL attributes.  This means
    that HTML templates can still be valid HTML, and produce valid HTML.
    For example:
    '<html><img tal:attributes="src imgSrc"></html>' is now valid, and will only
    output the <img> tag.
    
New features:
  - A simplification of how local variables are handled brings a 5-10%
    performance gain

Version 2.0
-----------
Complete refactoring of simpleTAL leading to very significant performance
improvements.  

Bug fixes:
  - Any unknown entity references present in a HTML template were not passed
    through to the rendered template, now they are.
  - Attributes created using tal:attributes did not have their values escaped
    properly

New features:
  - Large performance improvements by splitting the process into two
  - Templates once compiled can now be re-used, leading to large performance
    gains

Version 1.1
-----------
Bug fixes:
  - The "structure" keyword when used in XML templates would fail with an exception.
    
New features:
  - Added test cases for TALES and TAL (both HTML and XML)
  - Added allowTALInStructure flag to control expansion of TAL attributes

Version 1.0
-----------
Initial release.
