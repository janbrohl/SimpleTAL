simpleTAL / simpleTALES (Version 3.4)
-------------------------------------
Version 3.4
-----------
New features:
  - TemplateCache now uses MTIME rather than CTIME to spot
    changes to templates.
  - SimpleTAL is now compatible with PyXML 0.8.2 (Thanks to 
    Myers Carpenter for the testing).
  - Added support for passing in an XML Doctype when calling 
	template.expand
  - Added support to maintain XML singleton tags, including use of 
    METAL and TAL on singleton tags.
  - Added support for using variables in paths (e.g. If colour='blue' then
	the path 'colourMap/?colour' is equivalent to 'colourMap/blue').  This 
    is not part of the TALES specification, but is supported by Zope.
	(Thanks to Bastian Kleineidam for the initial implementation).
	
Bug fixes:
  - If the logging module was not installed exceptions would be thrown
    when SimpleTAL attempted to log errors - fixed.

Version 3.3
-----------
New features:
  - TemplateCache now supports inputEncoding, allowing HTML templates using 
    character sets other than ISO8859-1 to be used.
  - Functions path, string, exists, and nocall are available to python: paths.
  - Functions can now receive parameters via paths by wrapping them in 
    simpleTALES.PathFunctionVariable before placing them into the Context.
    
Bug fixes:
  - In tal:attributes and tal:define double escaped semi-colons are now handled.
  - Space after a semi-colon in tal:attributes and tal:define is now handled
    (thanks to Sean Reifschneider)
  - Handling of stray quotes at the start and end of attributes shouldn't interfere
    with python: paths anymore.

Version 3.2
-----------
This release incorporates patches from Wichert Akkerman implementing the Python TAL path
and moving to string methods instead of using the string module.

New features:
  - The 'python:' path can now be used, pass the parameter 'allowPythonPath=1' to the
	constructor of SimpleTALES.Context to enable this to be used.
  - simpleTALUtils now contains a template caching class (TemplateCache) that
    can be used to cache compiled templates, automatically invalidating the cache if
	the template file has changed.
  - The string module is no longer used, replaced by string methods
  
Bug fixes:
  - Nested repeat variables with the same name are now scoped correctly.
  - If logging is available all error messages are now suppressed during testing.

Version 3.1
-----------
With this release import statements need to be changed.  Please now use:
from simpletal import simpleTAL, simpleTALES.  The API has not changed.

New features:
  - SimpleTAL can now be installed using distutils, thanks to Michael Twomey.
    
Bug fixes:
  - If tal:repeat and tal:content were used on the same element, the last piece of
    content would be present twice - fixed.
  - If a path element inside a string: path evaluated to something other than a string or
    unicode string, it would not be evaluated.  Now an attempt to coerce the value to a 
    string is done using the str function.

Version 3.0
-----------
New features:
  - METAL Support added
  - The TAL and METAL name-spaces can now be bound to any prefix
  - When using XML Templates any elements in the TAL or METAL name-space
    have their start and end tags suppressed.

Version 2.3
-----------
Bug fixes:
  - Using tal:repeat on empty lists would cause an exception to be thrown.
    Now the repeating elements are removed from the output.

Version 2.2
-----------
Bug fixes:
  - HTML Document type declarations were not being passed through from the template
  - HTML Comments are now passed through to the output
  - End tags with no start tag now raise an error rather than failing silently
  - The first text element in a template is now combined with other text elements
  - XML Processing Instructions are now passed through the template correctly.

Version 2.1
-----------
Bug fixes:
  - HTML Templates will now suppress the output of close tags for elements
    that are forbidden to have them in HTML 4.01.  Additionally tags that 
    can have no close tag in HTML can still have TAL attributes.  This means
    that HTML templates can still be valid HTML, and produce valid HTML.
    For example:
    '<html><img tal:attributes="src imgSrc"></html>' is now valid, and will only
    output the <img> tag.
    
New features:
  - A simplification of how local variables are handled brings a 5-10%
    performance gain

Version 2.0
-----------
Complete refactoring of simpleTAL leading to very significant performance
improvements.  

Bug fixes:
  - Any unknown entity references present in a HTML template were not passed
    through to the rendered template, now they are.
  - Attributes created using tal:attributes did not have their values escaped
    properly

New features:
  - Large performance improvements by splitting the process into two
  - Templates once compiled can now be re-used, leading to large performance
    gains

Version 1.1
-----------
Bug fixes:
  - The "structure" keyword when used in XML templates would fail with an exception.
    
New features:
  - Added test cases for TALES and TAL (both HTML and XML)
  - Added allowTALInStructure flag to control expansion of TAL attributes

Version 1.0
-----------
Initial release.
